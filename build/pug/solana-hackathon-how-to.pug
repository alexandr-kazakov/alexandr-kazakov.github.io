                | Our team decided to participate in the 2022 Solana Hackathon, we decided to create the app that will scan QR codes to scan utility bills, bill in Solana, stabelcoins, SPL tokens, and make payments. We call it Gbits-Pay.

              p Our project is written in Vuejs + Web3js to work with the Solana network. In the app the user logs in with his Solana Wallet e.g. Phantom, after which he can scan QR codes of bills and pay them. Payments can be made in Solana, Stablecoins like Solana USDT and SPL tokens. We participated in tracks: Web3js, Mobile and Payments.

              p It's good for the project community to have a blog, Twitter, communicate in the official Solana Discord, etc etc.

              p Participating in the Solana Hackathon is a great opportunity to test your skills, there is only one minus: the large number of participants, it's not easy to win.
